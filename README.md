Modern scientific databases and web databases maintain large and heterogeneous data.
Traditional predefined query forms are not able to satisfy various ad-hoc queries from
users on those databases.

This project taking inspiration from the Dynamic Query Forms paper proposes DOF, a novel database query form interface, which is able to dynamically generate query forms. It helps in querying the Database even for non SQL programmers. We can write general queries and it will be automatically converted into SQL query.
